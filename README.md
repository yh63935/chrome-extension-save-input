<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Description
Chrome extension application used to save websites. You can either save the websites from an active tab or manually enter it yourself. This is a Scrimba project that I coded while following along with their course to [learn Javascript](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript). 

**Note: I am not associated with Scrimba, it is one of the resources that I am using currently to learn Javascript**

### Motivation
As someone who is learning to code on their own, I thought this application would be useful for saving sites that I had researched for learning Javascript. In the screenshot below, I saved Scrimba and Odin project to the extension.

### Reflection
This project definitely felt like a next step in my journey to Javascript. I learned how to save an input value and use it in my code. This was a limitation for my [Blackjack Game](https://github.com/yh63935/blackjack-game), where I wasn't sure how I would store an input value, so learning that and implementing in this project was very helpful! For the first time I was able to use my code to interact with the browser and collect data using an API and localStorage. Additionally, I learned how to deploy the extension from Chrome and was able to see and use it right in my browser which I thought was extremely cool! Finally, doing this project finally prompted me to look into how to write a good "README" file, which I will need to implement in my prior projects as well. 

### Built With

* HTML
* CSS

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Like mentioned above, this website tracker can be used to save various websites or input. In my case, I found it helpful to save sites for learning Javascript that I would want to access later.
